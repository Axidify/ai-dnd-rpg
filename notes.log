Refusing to be defeated by the chaotic scene, you decide to conduct one final, meticulous search. You ignore the wider clearing and focus entirely on the wreckage of the cart itself. You g
cart itself. You get down on your hands and knees, sifting through the spilled grain, turning over broken pieces of barrel, and carefully pushing aside the torn canvas, lg small, anything ooking for anything small, anything dropped and forgotten in the heat of the raid.

🎲 Investigation (INT): [16]+1 = 17 vs DC 13 = ✅ SUCCESS

🎲 Dungeon Master:
This time, your methodical approach pays off. As you sift through a pile of spilled grain and broken pottery near the cart's axle, your fingers brush against something hard and smooth. Yourd and smooth. You dig away the debris and unearth a small, sturdy wooden box, overlooked in the chaos. It's not locked.

Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, is a small, corked vial filled with a shimmering crimson liquid. It feels cool to the touch and hums with a faint, restorative energy. It seems thnergy. It seems the merchants had an emergency potion that the goblins completely missed in their violent haste.

Tucking the fortunate discovery away, you feel slightly better prepared for the dangers ahead. The path east still calls, leading deeper into the dark woods toward the cave.ve.
