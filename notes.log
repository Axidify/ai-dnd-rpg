📍 **The Rusty Dragon Tavern**

You push open the heavy oak door of the Rusty Dragon, and a wave of warmth washes over you, a welcome respite from the evening chill. The air inside is thick with the scent of wood smoke, roasting meat, and stale ale. A fire crackles merrily in a large stone hearth, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden tables. The low murmur of conversation from the handful of locals scattered around the room drops for a moment as they eye you, the newcomer, before returning to their drinks. In a far corner, a grim-faced warrior with a prominent scar across his cheek nurses a tankard, his gaze sweeping the room with a practiced, weary eye.

Before you can even decide whether to head for the bar or an empty table, a man lurches away from his seat and stumbles towards you. He's of middling years, dressed in the simple clothes of a farmer, but his face is pale and etched with panic. His eyes are bloodshot, wide with a sleepless terror. "Please," he says, his voice cracking with desperation. "You look strong. A warrior. You have to help me."

He grips your arm, his hand trembling. "Goblins... they came last night. From Darkhollow Cave. They... they took my daughter. My Lily." He swallows hard, his gaze pleading. "The village guard won't go. They say it's too dangerous. I don't have much, but I'll give you everything I have—fifty gold coins, our family's savings! Please, just bring her back to me." The farmer, whose name you learn is Bram, looks at you with raw, desperate hope, the quiet tavern now hanging on your reply.

i would like half as downpayment

Bram flinches slightly at the mention of payment, not from offense, but as if pulled from a waking nightmare back into the harsh reality of coin and contract. "Half?" he stammers, running a trembling hand through his matted hair. "Yes, of course. Whatever you need. Anything to get started."

He fumbles with a small, worn leather pouch tied to his belt, his clumsy fingers struggling with the knot. He finally gets it open and empties the contents into his calloused palm. His face falls as he looks at the meager pile. "I... I don't have that much on me," he says, his voice thick with shame. "I ran straight here from the farm. This is all I have with me."

He extends his shaking hand, offering you ten gold coins. "The rest, the other forty, it's buried at my farm. Safe. I swear on my life, it's yours the moment you bring Lily back. Please, will this be enough to show my good faith? It's all I have right now." The coins glint in the firelight, a small sum for such a desperate plea. From the corner of the room, you notice the scarred warrior, Marcus, watching the exchange with a flicker of interest.
